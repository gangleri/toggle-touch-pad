# toggle-touchpad
Originallyl written as a vim plugin I've included this as a shell script so that 
I can use it outside of vim.

## Install
Add it to a director on your path. I use the following:

```sh
% curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gangleri/toggle-touchpad/master/install.sh | sudo zsh
```

## Usage
```sh
% toggle-touchpad
# TouchPad is now off

% toggle-touchpad
# TouchPad is now on
```

A shortcut is setup as **ttp**.

I use this on Arch Linux running zsh on a Lenovo x250.
